# Tic Tac Toe
A simple implementation of the tic tac toe game with AI. 

AI was implemented using the minimax algorithm in JavaScript. 

Difficulty levels are achieved by giving each level a percentage threshold number between 0 and 100. 0 is for easy, 50 is for medium and 100 is for hard. Each time the computer plays, a random number between 0 and 100 is generated, and if that number is below the threshold, the computer uses the minimax move. If it is above the threshold, the computer uses a "reverse" minimax move that lets the human win instead.
